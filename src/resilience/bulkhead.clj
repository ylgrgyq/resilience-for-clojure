(defn ^BulkheadConfig bulkhead-config
  "Create a BulkheadConfig.

  Allowed options are:
  * :max-concurrent-calls
    Configures the max amount of concurrent calls the bulkhead will support.

  * :max-wait-millis
    Configures a maximum amount of time in ms the calling thread will wait
    to enter the bulkhead. If bulkhead has space available, entry is
    guaranteed and immediate. If bulkhead is full, calling threads will
    contest for space, if it becomes available. :max-wait-millis can be set to 0.

  * :writable-stack-trace-enabled
    Enables writable stack traces. When set to false, Exception#getStackTrace() returns a zero length array.
    This may be used to reduce log spam when the circuit breaker is open as the cause of the exceptions is already
    known (the circuit breaker is short-circuiting calls).

    Note: for threads running on an event-loop or equivalent (rx computation
    pool, etc), setting :max-wait-time to 0 is highly recommended. Blocking an
    event-loop thread will most likely have a negative effect on application
    throughput.
